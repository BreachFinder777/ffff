Fortifying Browsers Against Malicious Redirects: An Expanded Hybrid Detection Framework

This document outlines the system architecture for a hybrid framework designed to detect and prevent malicious web redirects in real-time. The framework provides a multi-layered defense by integrating three distinct analytical engines: heuristic analysis, graph-based behavior modeling, and domain reputation assessment.

System Architecture Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the complete workflow of the detection framework, from the initial user request to the final verdict and action. It details the parallel processing performed by the three core components and how their outputs are aggregated for a final decision.

Framework Components

The framework's strength lies in the synergistic combination of its three core components, which run in parallel to minimize latency.

1. Heuristic Analysis Engine

This engine acts as a rapid, first-line defense by performing static analysis on the URL.

Role: To catch common and unsophisticated threats quickly.

Process:

Feature Extraction: Extracts lexical and host-based features (e.g., URL length, character entropy, suspicious keywords).

Classification: A pre-trained Random Forest model classifies the URL based on these features to generate a risk score.

2. Graph-Based Behavior Analyzer

This component is designed to detect sophisticated, evasive attacks that use complex redirection chains.

Role: To analyze the dynamic behavior of a navigation sequence, not just a single URL.

Process:

RCG Construction: If an HTTP redirect is detected, it constructs a Redirect Chain Graph (RCG) in real-time.

Topological Analysis: It calculates metrics from the graph (e.g., chain length, node count, density) that are indicative of malicious Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS).

Anomaly Detection: A model flags chains with anomalous structural patterns.

3. Domain Reputation System

This engine provides critical external context by assessing the trustworthiness of every domain involved in the navigation.

Role: To leverage global threat intelligence to identify threats on otherwise legitimate-looking domains.

Process:

Data Aggregation: Queries multiple external sources in parallel for each domain in the chain.

Data Sources:

Threat Intelligence Feeds: Real-time checks against blocklists from Spamhaus, OpenPhish, etc.

Multi-Scanner Services: Aggregated verdicts from VirusTotal.

Domain Provenance: Checks domain age via WHOIS records.

Hosting Infrastructure: Analyzes IP-to-ASN reputation and passive DNS history.

Scoring: A weighted algorithm synthesizes these signals into a final reputation score.

Final Verdict

The risk scores from all three components are fed into a Final Aggregator / Meta-Classifier. This module uses a weighted voting system or a simple machine learning model to produce a definitive benign or malicious verdict. Based on this final decision, the user's navigation is either allowed to proceed or is blocked with a security warning.
